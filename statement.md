# Statement for File Management App

## Problem Statement

Managing files manually or through basic file explorers can be inefficient and confusing, especially for users who frequently create, read, edit, and delete numerous files. Users often face difficulties such as accidentally overwriting files, losing track of file contents, or struggling with the lack of a simple, unified interface to perform essential file operations seamlessly. This project aims to provide a straightforward, terminal-based file management solution that reduces these challenges by offering clear, interactive options to handle file operations safely.

## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a minimal yet functional command-line file management application. It supports core file operations including creation, listing, reading, editing (appending content), and deletion of files within the current working directory. The app provides a menu-driven interface, suitable for users with basic computer skills, aiming to simplify regular file management tasks without requiring advanced expertise or graphical tools. The scope is limited to local files and does not include advanced features like file search, metadata management, or multi-directory navigation.

## Target Users

- Students and beginners learning file handling concepts in programming.  
- Users who prefer terminal/command-line utilities for file management.  
- Developers or system administrators needing a quick tool to manage files without a GUI.  
- Anyone seeking a lightweight, easy-to-use file management solution for basic file operations.

## High-Level Features

- Create new files with error checks to avoid overwriting existing files.  
- View a list of all files and folders in the current directory.  
- Delete files with confirmation and error handling.  
- Read and display full content of any file in the directory.  
- Edit files by appending new content entered by the user.  
- Menu-driven interface with clear instructions for effortless navigation and operation.
